 Step 1: Check Python Version
First, verify which version of Python you are using. Open Command Prompt and type:

bash	Copy	Edit
python --version
Example output:

nginx	Copy	Edit
Python 3.10.6
Note down the version.

ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Download matplotlib and Dependencies (On Another PC with Internet)
On an internet-connected PC, open Command Prompt and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip download matplotlib numpy
This will download several .whl files into the current folder.

Copy all the downloaded .whl files onto a USB drive.

ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Install on Your Offline PC
Transfer the .whl files from the USB drive to your offline PC (e.g., F:\Tkinter\dependencies).

Open Command Prompt, navigate to the folder where .whl files are saved:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd F:\Tkinter\dependencies
Install the packages manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy-<version>.whl
pip install matplotlib-<version>.whl
(Replace <version> with the actual filename of the .whl files.)

ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Verify Installation
After installation, check if matplotlib is installed correctly:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__)"
If this prints a version number, matplotlib is installed successfully. ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ“Œ Step 5: Run Your Script
Now, open PyCharm, load your Tkinter graph plotting script, and run it.

This should work without errors! ðŸš€ Let me know if you need any help.

Great! Since you're now on an online PC, you can easily install the required dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install matplotlib numpy
Then, run your Tkinter script in PyCharm to test if it works. Once everything is working online, you can follow the offline installation steps I provided earlier to set it up on your offline PC.

Let me know if you need any modifications or improvements in your script! ðŸš€

Since you're using a virtual environment (.venv) in PyCharm, you need to install matplotlib inside that environment. Follow these steps:

ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Activate the Virtual Environment in PyCharm
Open PyCharm and go to Terminal (bottom panel).

Run the following command to activate the environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
F:\Tkinter\.venv\Scripts\activate
Now, install matplotlib and numpy:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install matplotlib numpy
ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Verify the Installation
After installation, check if matplotlib is installed correctly:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__)"
If it prints a version number, it's installed successfully.

ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Run Your Script
Now, try running your Tkinter script in PyCharm:

bash
Copy
Edit
F:\Tkinter\.venv\Scripts\python.exe F:\Tki
